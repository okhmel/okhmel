
# My Performance Reviews

Performance Review should help you realize how the performed jobs and other contributions fit within the bigger picture of SoftServe.
Performance Review events within the People Excellence 2.0 program are the regular events that are held every 6 months for associates on levels 1-3 (Junior, Middle, and Senior) and every 12 months for levels 4 and 5 (Lead and Expert). The goal of such events is to qualify the work, give appropriate recommendations, and assure continuous competence growth.
The People Excellence 2.0 application is used to process such events and assure effectiveness in terms of schedule, evaluation process, and competence development.
The Performance Review, in general, includes the following stages:

## Functional Review consisting of

- **Self-Review** – when you fill in the self-review form reviewing the jobs you performed during the evaluated period.
- **Evaluation** – when an expert evaluates your work, validates the quality, and provides recommendations for improvement. After the evaluation, you will receive a notification to submit a feedback on your evaluator.
- **Team Review** – the teammates provide feedback on your functional competencies. They can submit their forms throughout the whole Review stage until the manager generates the outcomes of the Performance Review.
- **Soft Competencies Review** – where you, your teammates, and the manager from your project evaluate your soft competencies.
- **Performance Review Outcomes meeting** – where you and your manager discuss the outcomes of the Functional Review and Soft Competencies Review and set the goals for the next period.

# Self-Review

When the launch date comes, your Performance Review event switches to the **Review stage**. At that stage, you should complete a self-review form reviewing the work you did during the evaluated period. Additionally, you should review your [soft competencies](https://www.bing.com) and fill in the corresponding form in the application.

The self-review form contains the list of competencies with the defined jobs that you should cover within your Primary profile and not obligatory within your additional profiles, if any. You should submit the forms for each profile separately. Find more information about the additional profiles [here](https://www.example.com). In the form, you can also find the corresponding knowledge description and attached knowledge items for you to master certain jobs.

**To complete a self-review form:**

1.On the widget, select **Review**.
If you have the Secondary or Role profiles, switch between them below the widget to complete each available form. The profile tile displays a progress circle of marked jobs within the form.

<div style="background-color: #F2F2F2"> <strong> Note: </strong> If it is not your first Performance Review event, then you may see the   labels in the review form indicating the new items in the current Job Standard (job, level, competency) comparing to its previous version.</div>

2.For every job in every competency, select the proper responses:

- In the **functional competencies form:**
   Select **Yes** if you performed this job during the evaluated period, or select **No** if you didn't.

- In the **soft competencies form:**
   Select **Yes** if you demonstrated the behavior that matches the description during the evaluated period, 6 or 12 months respectively, or select **No** if you didn't.

- Add a comment if you want to specify the details and confirm your experience in the particular job. For this, select Shape Comments icon in the **Comments** column. Then, type your comment in the text field and click **Save**.

To view details about a certain job, including job description, knowledge items, and the list of related skills, click Shape Plus icon.

3.When you mark all jobs in all competencies within the profile, click **Submit**.
